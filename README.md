# InstagramBot
This is a little project that I made for my brothers in order to increase the reach of their 
Instagram business page.  
  
It automates the process of interacting with Instagram posts and profiles based on a 
specified set of hashtags.

## Requirements:
- The latest Python interpreter
- The Firefox browser

## Steps to run the bot:
1. Install package requirements, specified in requirements.txt (e.g. with pip: pip3 install -r requirements.txt)
2. Edit the config.yml file and enter your credentials as well as your desired configuration
3. Open up a command line terminal in the working directory of the program
4. Enter the following commands:
    - cd src
    - python bot.py
